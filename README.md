# Reino de las Bestias 🐺🔥

Mobile application that reflects a person’s inner nature  
through an archetype of an animal and an element.

This project is **not a test, not a diagnosis, not a horoscope**.  
It is a calm, visual way to recognize yourself.

## 🌿 Concept
Each person has a core nature.
It shows up in decisions, reactions to pressure, and movement through life.

Reino de las Bestias helps you see this nature  
through an image — **animal + element**.

## 📱 Frontend
- Expo (React Native)
- Expo Router
- Multilanguage (RU / EN / ES / PT)

- Share-first flow (before paywall)
